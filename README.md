# Counting Polyominos Algorithem

- Implementing the algorithm to enumerate fixed polyominoes. <br />
- The algorithm calculates fixed(n) for n up to specified limit n. <br />

---

## About the project
- The code is in python.
- The files in the projects are: init.py, gui.py and test.py
- you can run the code from init.py file which in counting_polyominos folder
    - enter a number and get back the number of fixed polyominos.
- you can run the gui.py file (which import the algorithm from init.py)
    - get a nice gui window (see below).
    - enter a number x , click the button and the number of x fixed polyomis will be printed out to the screen.
