# countingPolyominos

Implementing the algorithm to enumerate fixed polyominoes. <br />
The algorithm calculates fixed(n) for n up to specified limit N. <br />
The algorithm appear in the paper: Counting polyominoes: yet another attack, D.Hugh Redelmeier [1979] <br />
The code is in python and there is a test file.
